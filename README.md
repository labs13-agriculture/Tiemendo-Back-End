# API Documentation

#### Backend deployed at [tieme-ndo-backend](https://tieme-ndo-backend.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- Set up PostgreSQL database locally with name, username, and password "tiemendo" 
- Alternatively, change name, username, and password values to your liking in applications.properties file
- Local testing is currently configured using localhost port 4040

### The Stack
Java Rest Api Built with Spring Framework on a postgres database deployed to Heroku

-    `Spring` allows for amazing customization and extensibility
-    `Hibernate` makes for intuitive and easy access to our database and works so smoothly with spring
-    `Postgresql` is an amazing relational database that can handle our extensive models and integrates great with Herok
-    `Heroku` is such a great platform that effortless integrates with our spring application and maven build. and a smooth CI pipeline directly plugged into github

## 3️⃣ Environment Variables

🚫 Currently no environment variables need to be set, keeping this in case that changes

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.
create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
